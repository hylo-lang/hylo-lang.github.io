title: Contributing to Hylo
---

TODO: describe high-level overview of how they can help, link to relevant guides, and motivate contributors.

See previous introduction here: https://github.com/hylo-lang/hylo?tab=contributing-ov-file

Draft:

Kinds of Contributions
- feature requests
- compiler bug reports
- help with infrastructure
- help with improving our documentation
- help with website development
- research in tooling or in language design see [Research Collaboration](/docs/contributing/research-collab)
- tooling development (vscode extension, language server, etc)
- compiler development (note, hardcore - will take time to ramp up)


TODO: Describe the categorized topics within the project and who they should contact for each. Maybe link to filtered set of issues on GitHub by categories.

It may be useful to somehow unite the issues from multiple repos so that they are more discoverable.
