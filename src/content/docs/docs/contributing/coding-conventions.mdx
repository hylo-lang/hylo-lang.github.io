title: Coding Conventions
---

This document lists the coding conventions that shall be followed by Hylo contributors and assumed when interpreting
code in the Hylo codebase, unless otherwise specified in the project's README.

For now, this is empty and up for discussion. As a starting point, read [Better Code: Chapter 2](https://github.com/stlab/better-code/blob/main/better-code/src/chapter-2-contracts.md#project-wide-documentation-policies).
