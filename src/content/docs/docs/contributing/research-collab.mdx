Research is one of our core pillars at Hylo. We collaborate with universities and individuals around the world to push
the frontiers of PL research, library design and developer tooling. If you are interested in collaborating with us either as a
student, professor or independent contributor, please reach out via <a href={slackLink}>Slack</a> or
<a href={discussionsLink}>GitHub</a>, so we can help you get started.
