<Aside type="caution">
    The compiler is in active development, so many features don't work yet. There are also some cases when the compiler
    fails to emit useful diagnostics and crashes instead. If you encounter any issues, please
    [file an issue](https://github.com/hylo-lang/hylo/issues/) or reach out on
    [Slack]({slackLink}).
</Aside>

Hylo is available on [Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org/z/P7ooxsacd) for you to experiment with without needing to
install anything locally. We do not yet have pre-built binaries available for download (contributions welcome!), but if
you want to run the compiler locally, you can [build it from source](/docs/contributing/building-the-compiler).
