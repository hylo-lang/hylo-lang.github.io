title: Debugger Support for Hylo
---
## Existing Research on LLDB based Debugging:

Debugger support for Hylo has been researched by Tudor-Stefan Magirescu at Delft University of Technology. He got basic
debugging support for Hylo working using LLDB, just by modifying Swifty-LLVM and the Hylo IR to LLVM transpilation
process. More advanced features such as visualizing existential types will most likely require making an LLDB plugin or
forking LLDB as Swift did. All of these, and more are covered in detail in Tudor's thesis, which you can find at

    Although the research provides a great working prototype, the implementation is not yet transferred to a
    production-ready state yet. Further work is also needed to research and prototype the advanced debugging features
    such as debugging existential types, structured concurrency, and to integrate a safer, Hylo compiler based
    expression evaluator. Join the discussion at [Debuggers for New Languages (&
    Hylo) - Research Topic](https://github.com/orgs/hylo-lang/discussions/1768) for more information and to get involved!

## DWARF
Hylo is an [officially acknowledged language](https://dwarfstd.org/issues/240213.1.html) in the DWARF debugging standard
as of version 6. We were lucky enough to get the following codes:

- `DW_LANG_Hylo` = `0x0042`
- `DW_LNAME_Hylo` = `0x0028`
