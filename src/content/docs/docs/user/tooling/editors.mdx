title: IDE Extensions
---

A language is much more enjoyable with some great editor support. At the moment, we have syntax highlighting extensions
for VSCode and Emacs, and you can use
[Hylo's TextMate grammar](https://github.com/hylo-lang/vscode-hylo/blob/main/syntaxes/hylo.tmLanguage.json) to add support for
other editors.

<Aside title="Help wanted!">
    The [language server](https://github.com/hylo-lang/hylo-language-server) is work in progress, currently not yet
    available within these extensions. Contact us on <a href={slackLink}>Slack</a> if you want to join its development
    or help with integrating it to various editors!

## Visual Studio Code Extension
Search for the extension named "Hylo" in the VSCode marketplace:
![Hylo extension in VSCode](./assets/vscode.png)

This extension also adds code execution support, so if you want to set that up, check out [its documentation](https://github.com/hylo-lang/vscode-hylo/).

## Emacs: Hylo mode
We have an Emacs mode for Hylo in [this repository](https://github.com/hylo-lang/hylo-mode), which provides basic syntax
highlighting. LSP support is not yet integrated.

## Zed, IntelliJ, and Others...
You can use the [Hylo's TextMate grammar](https://github.com/hylo-lang/vscode-hylo/blob/main/syntaxes/hylo.tmLanguage.json)
of Hylo to easily add syntax highlighting support to other editors. If you have created an extension, please let us know
so that we can promote it here, and possibly move it to the [Hylo GitHub organization](https://github.com/hylo-lang/)!
