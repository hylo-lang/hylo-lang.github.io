TODO write a blog post about what it takes to build the infrastructure for a new programming language, and what the next steps are:
- build and package the compiler
- make docker images with the Hylo compiler pre-installed
- testing framework for Hylo (way later)
- package manager for Hylo (probably using GitHub as a package registry, at least initially).
- migrate the documentation compiler to use the new frontend, and set up automatic deployments of the standard library documentation to GitHub pages.
