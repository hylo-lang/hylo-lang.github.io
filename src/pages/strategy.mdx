title: Our Strategy
layout: ../layouts/Page.astro
---

Desires:
- Solid core language and a working compiler
- Great UX for developer tooling
  - Diagnosis:
    - Compilers can be very slow
    - Lagging IDEs are frustrating
    - Crashing LSPs are frustrating
    - Lack of proper debugging value inspection -> slower debugging
    -
  - Strategic Objectives:
    - Reasonably fast compile time from scratch (for a medium-sized project, 2-3 minutes)
    - Fast incremental compile time (under 8 seconds)
    - Responsive IDE experience (under 200ms for common operations - todo clarify)
    - Good code quality of the compiler and tools.
  - Actions
    - testing, code review, benchmarking, profiling, CI/CD
    - explore SOTA LSP and debugger testing techniques, make new ones if needed

## Guiding Policies and Strategic Actions

### 1. Curiosity and Research
We push the boundaries of the state-of-the-art by being research-driven: studying the
industry's existing approaches and relevant academic literature, engaging with domain experts of our problems, and
experimenting with new ideas.

### 2. Collaboration over Competition

We see language development as a shared effort, not a zero-sum game. We learn from Swift, Rust, C++, and
Odin among others, and we give back through blog posts, bug reports, patches, research findings, and libraries we build along the way. By sharing
our work early and helping others, we get feedback, connections, and make faster progress than we would alone. We value the
world's success first, the community's second, and personal success third - generosity ultimately strengthens all
of them.

### 3. Evolving Practical Trade-offs
import {discussionsLink, slackLink} from '../links.js';

We don't believe a successful systems programming language can exist without trade-offs, nor that we can get them all
right from the start. Therefore, we aim to document our design decisions in <a href={discussionsLink}>GitHub Discussions</a>, so that we can revisit
them later and make it easy to add resources or comment on them over time.
